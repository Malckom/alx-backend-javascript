**What is ES6?**
ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a major update to JavaScript that introduced new syntax and features aimed at improving the language's usability and performance. It enhances the capabilities of JavaScript for building complex applications, making it more powerful and easier to work with.

****New Features Introduced in ES6****
ES6 introduced several significant features, including:

    Arrow Functions: A more concise syntax for writing function expressions.
    Template Literals: String literals allowing embedded expressions and multi-line strings.
    Destructuring Assignment: A syntax for unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
    Default Parameters: Functions can have default values for parameters.
    Rest and Spread Operators: Simplifying the handling of function arguments and array manipulations.
    Classes: A new syntax for creating objects and handling inheritance.
    Modules: Support for modular programming through import and export statements.
    Promises: A native way to handle asynchronous operations.

****Difference Between a Constant and a Variable****
The key differences between constants and variables in JavaScript are:

    Constant: A constant is a value that cannot be changed once it is assigned. In JavaScript, constants are declared using the const keyword. For example:

    javascript
    const PI = 3.14;

Variable: A variable can hold different values over time. Variables are declared using var, let, or const. For example:

```
javascript
let age = 25;
age = 30; // This is valid
```

****Block-Scoped Variables****
In ES6, variables declared with let and const are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they were defined in (e.g., inside a loop or an if statement). This contrasts with var, which is function-scoped. For example:

```
javascript
if (true) {
    let x = 10;
}
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

****Arrow Functions and Default Parameters****
Arrow functions provide a concise way to write functions. They also lexically bind the this value, which means they inherit this from their surrounding context. An example of an arrow function with default parameters is:

```
javascript
const add = (a, b = 1) => a + b;
console.log(add(5)); // Output: 6
```

****Rest and Spread Function Parameters****
The rest operator (...) allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The spread operator allows an iterable such as an array to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected. Examples include:

```
javascript
// Rest parameters
function sum(...numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr);
}
```
```
// Spread operator
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5]; // arr2 is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

****String Templating in ES6****
Template literals allow for multi-line strings and string interpolation using backticks (`). You can embed expressions within template literals using ${expression}. For example:

```
javascript
const name = "Alice";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

****Object Creation and Their Properties in ES6****
ES6 introduced a shorthand syntax for defining object properties when the property name matches the variable name. For example:

```
javascript
const name = 'John';
const age = 30;

const person = { name, age }; // Equivalent to { name: name, age: age }
```

****Iterators and For-of Loops****
The for-of loop provides a simpler way to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, maps, and sets. It allows direct access to each element without needing to use an index. For example:

```
javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3];
for (const value of array) {
    console.log(value); // Outputs: 1, then 2, then 3
}
```
